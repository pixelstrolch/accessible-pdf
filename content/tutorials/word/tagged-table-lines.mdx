## Issue description

When exporting a table from Word 2013, the lines of a table are set within `<Span>` tags. `<Span>` tags are not allowed inside a `<TR>` (table row) on the same level as the `<TD>` tags (table cell). In addition, table lines must be marked as artifacts and must not be tagged.

Issue detected in PDFs made from:

- Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows

### PAC 3 error message

> Invalid use of a “Span” structure element

### Failure Conditions of the Matterhorn Protocol

> **01-001** Artifact is tagged as real content. (→ [manual testing](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/glossary/#manual-testing))
> 
> **09-004** A table-related structure element is used in a way that does not conform to the syntax defined in ISO 32000-1, Table 337. (→ [automatic testing](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/glossary/#automatic-testing))

## Manual approach in Acrobat

1. The path element must be marked as Artifact. Right-click on the path element inside the navigation pane “Tags” and choose “Change Tag to Artifact…”.
2. Delete the empty `<Span>` tag afterwards.
