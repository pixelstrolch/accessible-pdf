> **01-006** The structure type and attributes of a structure element are not semantically appropriate for the structure element. All of the existing structure types must be taken into account. (→ [manual testing](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/glossary/#manual-testing))

## Manual approach in Word

For the directory entries Word uses the paragraph styles

- TOC 1
- TOC 2
- …

Within the paragraph settings of each paragraph style you can define the outline level. If the styles above have not “Body Text” defined for the outline level, the heading tags are going to be applied. So, you need to change them to the “Body Text” option.
