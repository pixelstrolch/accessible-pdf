## Issue description

A PDF converted from Word contains the `<Part>` element as its top container. However, the semantically more suitable `<Document>` tag should be used as root element.

Issue detected in PDFs made from:

- Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows

### PAC 3 warning

> “Part” structure element used as root element

### Failure Condition of the Matterhorn Protocol

> **01-006** The structure type and attributes of a structure element are not semantically appropriate for the structure element. All of the existing structure types must be taken into account. (→ [manual testing](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/glossary/#manual-testing))

## Manual approach in Acrobat

The topmost `<Part>` tag must be changed into the `<Document>` tag, see [“Change PDF tags in Acrobat”](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/basics/change-pdf-tags-in-acrobat/).
