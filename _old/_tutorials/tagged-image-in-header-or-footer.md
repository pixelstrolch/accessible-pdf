## Issue description

Everything you put into the header or footer of a Word document, is going to be an Artifact and not tagged. Therefore, images with content value mustn’t be placed in it.

Images within the header or footer of a `.docx` (Word 2013 document without compatibility mode) are incorrectly tagged if they are used with the “Behind Text” layout option.

Issue detected in PDFs made from:

- Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows

### PAC 3 warning/error

There is no warning or error for this issue.

### Failure Condition of the Matterhorn Protocol

> **01-001** Artifact is tagged as real content. (→ [manual testing](https://accessible-pdf.info/en/glossary/#manual-testing))

## Manual approach in Word 2013

Since this issue only exists with the layout option “Behind Text” you might change this option if possible.

## Manual approach in Acrobat

1. The “Reading Order” tool can be used to select such an image
2. The button “Background/Artifact” changes the image to an Artifact
3. Repeat this step for each header or footer image
