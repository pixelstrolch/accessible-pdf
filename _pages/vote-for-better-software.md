Adobe and Microsoft both have UserVoice pages that allow you to report software bugs and feature requests. This allows us to report problems that exist with the creation of accessible PDFs. 

Unfortunately, those requests do not always receive the attention they actually need. So please help to push these issues and vote for them.
