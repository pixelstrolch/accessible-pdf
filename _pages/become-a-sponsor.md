I use a lot of my spare time to maintain this website and to write posts for it. 
I love doing it and want to help others to create better documents.

You might wanna support me with that and [become a sponsor on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/pixelstrolch). The available tiers are:

- ☕️ **Coffee time!** [$2 a month] 
You’ll receive a **sponsor badge** and **show your appreciation**.
- 🙌 **You’re awesome!** [$4 a month] 
Same as tier above. Additionally you **help me to pay the bills** for web hosting and the domain.
- 🚀 **You absolutely rock!** [$8 a month] 
Same as tier above. I will send you **a sticker** with the logo of the website. **Only rockstars like you will get one.**
- 🏅 **Hello Gold sponsor!** [$16 a month] 
Same as tier above. **Your name will be displayed on this website**

**[Become a sponsor now](https://github.com/sponsors/pixelstrolch).** Thank you so much 💚
